# Static Prototype Functions Lab

## Objectives

1. Define a static function on a class.
2. Build a batch constructor.

## Instructions

The goal of this lab is to build a function on an `IcebreakerResponse` class that can create many instances of icebreaker responses using the prototype style of javascript classes.

The function `IcebreakerResponse` already exists within `IcebreakerResponse.js`. Your job is to attach a function directly onto the object `IcebreakerResponse` called `BatchCreate` that can take in an array of emails and for each email, it should instantiate an `IcebreakerResponse` with that email.
